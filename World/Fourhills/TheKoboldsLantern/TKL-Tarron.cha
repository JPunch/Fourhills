##NAME:Tarron (barkeeper)
##DESCRIPTION
A bald, ugly human
Well built
No family left
Spent many years in the castle dungeon for a suspected assassiation plot

Soft spot in his heart for Lady Turtlerobe - she spared him from the death sentence and got the charges reduced and eventually dropped. She's the reason he didn't spend the rest of his life in the city dungeon.
