##NAME:Lady Turtlerobe
##DESCRIPTION
45 years old but her hair is already white
Husband died four years ago

Wears a simple navy blue dress with cold-coloured shield symbols dotted over it
Grew up in an already-aristocratic family
	Parents were distant, she bonded mostly with her nanny
	Rarely allowed outside the grounds of the mansion
	Ran away age 12, had a thoroughly miserable time, found again a few days later
	Inspired by the plight of the lower classes that she saw when seh ran away
	Age 16 she went out to distribute food to homeless people and to nurse the sick
	Went out on these trips for about two years before she got married to her cousin, Lord Turtlerobe
	Gradually got used to fitting in with what was expected of her - to be Lady Turtlerobe
	Still has a kind heart
	
Son is missing
A few days ago, Kirrol went to Ranbury to visit a friend - I've never heard of the place
I'm worried sick for his safety
He's my only help around the house, ever since my dear husband passed away four years ago
Lord Turtlerobe was a great man - very kind hearted to those in need.
Oh the fun we used to have... I used to call him... Lord Turtlerobe
My son carried my platinum sceptre in his pack, a resurrection potion and a few other valuables - if you return him safely to me, you can keep them as a reward.
I can see you are tired from your journey - I will not ask you to make the trek to day.
Please, take this gold and stay a night at the pub down the road. It serves an excellent range of themed cocktails. The Halfling, I think it's called.
Then, tomorrow, make haste.
Please, return my son to me - I have another son but he's no use - practically a scoundrel. Ja-min just terrorises the poor people of the city.
Now... go!
