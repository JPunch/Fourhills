## Walton

A small village, inhabited mostly by humans. There's a square (200ft. by 150ft.), with a monument
in the middle, and houses around the outside. The monument is of an old tiefling
heroine, Damaiya, who defended the town against an invasion by humans, many (~100) years ago. It
looks like her tail broke off and has been re-made recently.

In the day, it's quite busy, with carts and such going about. It quietens down
at night time.

There's a pub on the right hand side of the square, as you enter from the bottom.
It's called "The Copper Sword". There are some thugs hanging around it who might
want a bribe...

There's a butcher's shop, a carpenter's shop, a bakery, a smith's, and a few others.
The people here aren't very into magic. Some are religious and worship Silvanus,
neutral god of wild nature (symbol: oak leaf). There is a small temple on the north
side of the village square.

The wood to the south has a wide variety of wildlife and plantlife. Much of the trade
of the village is about turning natural resources into useful things - furniture,
meat, firewood, nonmagical potions and some other things.

A battle may occur here.
